This project uses python libraries like Keras and Tensorflow to tell If an Image has been manipulated or not. I chose the approach of using transfer learning for getting more accurate results.

This project requires the following dependencies:-
 * EEl - Used for displaying webpages using a local host environment,it also allows python functions to be implemented in JavaScript
 * Keras
 * Tensorflow
 * Pillow
 * Numpy
 * Pandas
 * Tkinter
